First step in my surgical journey: small tests to determine my health for more advanced tests Friday. 
Did anyone else know they now require 15 ml of spit for the COVID test? For the record, that is a ton of saliva. 
And the woman ahead of me is nailing it. 
One step at a time ... 
(Apologies for the pic of my spit).
